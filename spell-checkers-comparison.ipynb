    "\n",
    "### Dataset format\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyzed dataset is a set of english correctly spelled words as well as variations of their incorrect spelling, collected by Wikipedia editors. Most of the spell checking tools support the ability to find errors and correct them in English texts, so English was selected for testing. File with the data can be downloaded from this [article](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/spelling?resource=download&select=wikipedia.txt) (file ['wikipedia_misspells.txt'](https://github.com/diffitask/spell-checkers-comparison/blob/main/data/wikipedia_misspells.txt) has already been downloaded and put in the *data* folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there are interesting ways to generate misspelled words from the correct ones described in this [article](https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume176/number27/yunus-2020-ijca-920288.pdf), where it is suggested to swap letters, add new letters and use keyboard characters relative positions. However, in this work I have so far stopped at the Wikipedia dataset described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to download more datasets for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dataset parsing method presented here, any files with data in the following format will be suitable:\n",
    "*{'the correct word': 'its incorrect spelling 1', 'incorrect spelling 2', ..., 'incorrect spelling N'}*\n",
    "For example, [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/spelling?select=aspell.txt), [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/spelling?select=birkbeck.txt) and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/spelling?select=spell-testset2.txt) datasets from the site mentioned above can also be used in testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset reading and dictionary creating\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a different number of potential misspelled forms are presented for each correct word in the dataset, it's impossible to use the *read_csv* method from *pandas* library, where it's required the same number of columns-features for each row. So the dataset will be processed line by line."

    "# Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics group\n",
    "Metrics for spell checker evaluating can be divided into 3 groups:\n",
    "1. Metrics that evaluate the tool's ability to **classify words as right spelled or misspelled**\n",
    "2. Metrics that evaluate the tool's ability to **correct misspelled words**\n",
    "3. Others\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics of each group\n",
    "1. To understand the 1st metrics group, this [article](https://gerhard.pro/files/PublicationVanHuyssteenEiselenPuttkammer2004.pdf) can be helpful. I relied on this paper, but changed the approach to putting positive and negative labels, based on the idea that we are still looking for misspelled words (as in the problem of detecting cancerous tumors, we usually label cancerous cases as positives). I chose standard metrics without the additional subdivision, described in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus,  there will be used the following metrics:\n",
    "    * **Recall**\n",
    "    * **Precision**\n",
    "    * **Classifying Accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second group I will use these metrics:\n",
    "    * **Percent of words** that are **invalid after checker work**\n",
    "    * **Percent of the misspelled words**, that were **correctly fixed** by spellchecker\n",
    "    * **Percent of non-fixed misspelled words**, but for which the right decision was **in top-5** spellchecker suggested word **candidates**\n",
    "    * **Percent of** originally correct spelled words that were **broken** by the checker\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In 3rd group there was put one metric:\n",
    "    * Checker work **speed**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulas and explanation of each metric\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are looking for misspelled words, positive labels will be set for invalid words with the misspellings, negative labels -- for valid correct spelled words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that way:\n",
    "* **True positives (tp)** -- invalid words, recognized by spelling checker as misspelled.\n",
    "* **False positives (fp)** -- valid words, recognized by checker as misspelled.\n",
    "* **True negatives (tn)** -- valid words, recognized by checker as right spelled.\n",
    "* **False negatives (fn)** -- invalid words, recognized by checker as right spelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall -- number of invalid words that were recognized by the checker as misspelled (true positives), in relation to the total number of invalid words in the text (sum of true positives and false negatives)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The ideal for the spelling checker -- to recognize all invalid words as misspelled $\\Rightarrow$ to get as high recall as possible, the closer to 100% the better.\n",
    "Recall indicates comprehensiveness of the lexicon of the spelling checker and whether the spelling checker lexicon contains any erroneous words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision -- number of words, that were marked by checker as misspelled and which are really incorrect, in relation to the total number of words, that checker marked as misspelled (sum of true positives and false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ precision = \\frac{tp}{tp + fp} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal for the checker -- to recognize all invalid and only invalid words as misspelled $\\Rightarrow$ to get as high precision as possible, the closer to 100% the better.\n",
    "Precision indicates how accurate is the spelling checker in assigning misspell flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Identifying Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy shows what the spelling checker does right (the sum of true positives and true negatives) in terms of everything the spelling checker does (all true and false positives and negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ identifyingAccuracy = \\frac{tp + tn}{tp + fp + tn + fn} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a good overall view of the competence of a checker, since it determines how accurate a spelling checker is at performing the errand it was sent on. The better spell checking tool works, the higher accuracy $\\Rightarrow$ the ideal for the checker -- to get 100% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Percent of words that are invalid after checker work\n",
    "$$ invalidsAfterCheckerPerc = \\frac{invalidsAfterCheckerWork}{nWordsInText} $$\n",
    "The ideal for spellchecker -- 0% -- when all words in text after checker work are valid. The lower, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Percent of correctly fixed misspellings\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ fixedMisspellingsPerc = \\frac{fixedMisspellings}{allMisspellsInText} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal for spellchecker -- 100%. The higher, the better.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ notFixedButInTop5Perc = \\frac{notFixedButCorrectionInTop5Candidates}{notFixedMisspells} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Selected tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider 6 speech checking tools:\n",
    "1. *Pyspellchecker* library\n",
    "2. *Textblob* library\n",
    "3. Pre-trained model from *Spello* library\n",
    "4. *Hunspell* spelling corrector\n",
    "5. *Jamspell* spelling corrector\n",
    "6. *Autocorrect* library\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base SpellCorrector class description\n",
    "\n",
    "For the convenience of working with these tools, a base class *SpellCorrector* was created and each spell checker was wrapped in a class-inheritor of the SpellCorrector.\n",
    "\n",
    "SpellCorrector has method *correct* that takes as input a list of words and the position of the analyzed word in it. Almost all tools could be given just an analyzed word as input, but the Jamspell interface requires that a list of words and a position be given, so for uniformity, all methods are built this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the output method *correct* returns one of two:\n",
    "* either single word (**str** type) that matches the original one -- this means that the checker considered the word given to him as right spelled and did not correct it\n",
    "* either a **list** of all candidates that the spell checker suggested for the word -- in this case, we believe that the checker classifies the word submitted to him as incorrect and tries to correct it\n",
    "\n",
    "Code was inspired by [Jamspell](https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell) realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encountered difficulty\n",
    "Unfortunately, not all analyzed spell checking tools have a method that, based on the entered word, would say whether this checker considers this word to be correct or incorrect. Hunspell has an explicit method, Spello prescribed in the documentation, for the rest of the tools I had to come up with solutions myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT! Models downloading\n",
    "\n",
    "For some analyzed tools, it's necessary to download model files before code running.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't upload them to the GitHub due to their large size, so to run the code you need to follow these steps:\n",
